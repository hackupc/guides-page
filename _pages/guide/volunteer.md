Also, you can contact with your team lead, as we’ll explain below, with any problem.

### What happens if I don’t know something? :thinking:
During the event, hackers will ask you lots of questions, **it’s okay if you don’t know the answer.** When this happens act cool and let them know you will figure out an answer. You can ask us anytime on the #staff slack channel or through the phone.
