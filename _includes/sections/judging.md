Because complete fairness is difficult to achieve, we have tried to establish a few guidelines that we’d like you to follow. Please, keep in mind that the quality of the pitch/presentation of the project **is not** what matters. Some of the hackers may also be good sellers, that’s why we need to see through that and judge the very foundations of their projects.

That being said, the teams will be judged on the following three criteria, all of them having the same weight. Participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project. If they missed any aspect, don’t hesitate to ask them about it.

### Technology

- How technically impressive was the hack?
- Was the technical problem that the team tackled difficult?
- Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components?
- Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?

### Idea & Innovation

- How good is the idea?
- Does it go beyond a website that already exists?
- Is it creative?

### Learning

- Did the team stretch themselves?
- Did they try to learn something new?
- What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team that always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.

We also have some auxiliary criteria, which will be explained during the briefing.

These criteria should guide you in making the best decisions, but ultimately you are free to trust your gut feeling.
